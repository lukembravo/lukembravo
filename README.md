## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a masters degree in business analytics at the McCombs School of Business (University of Texas at Austin). I'm looking forward to beginning a career in an analyst or consultant position, using data science and my background in marketing and research. I strive to integrate creativity and ingenuity in all aspects of my work and personal lives. 

Outside of my academic life, I enjoy a number of hobbies and creative outlets. Music has always been something I love to spend spare time doing and playing with different bands in New Orleans while studying at Tulane is something I'll always think back fondly on. One of my favorite ways to enjoy the outdoors is to backpack or mountain bike. I've also been on boats and have fished in rivers, streams, bays, and deep seas for as long as I can remember. Another way I spend my time is doing freelance graphic design and online marketing. It started as an interest in digital art and animation, and has turned into working with a range of clients from cosmetic brands to realtors to restaurants and more ...

### *Anomaly Detection in Energy Use* [:link:](https://github.com/lukembravo/anomaly_detection_in_energy_use)
![energy_anomaly_detection.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7bamvQA.jpg)

How does energy consumption vary over time across different meters at different sites? How can we identify normal and abnormal consumption in order to improve efficiency? This group project was based on a large set of time series data provided by Schneider Electric for a competition. Check out our code or our [article on Medium](https://indialindsay1.medium.com/identifying-anomalies-in-commercial-energy-consumption-b0e72f569bb2) to see how we used XGBoost, Bayesian changepoint analysis, and more to pick out anomalies in data heavily influenced by seasonality and propose potential avenues for consumption optimization.

The Data: [`Schneider Electric Exchange`](https://shop.exchange.se.com/en-US/apps/39025/detecting-anomalies-in-building-energy-usage)

### *Retail Diet Diversity* [:link:](https://github.com/lukembravo/retail_diet_diversity)
![retail_diet_diversity.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1Oz71ud.jpg)

What patterns can we find hidden in geographic, inventory, and health-related information about stores in Vietnam? In this methods-focused project, our group used several types correlation and regression analyses, tuned parameters for a multilayered perceptron model, and more. If we can identify key characteristics shared among the most successful stores across two Hanoi districts, we can build a model for profitability and longevity, and predict the success of new entrants or future ventures.
